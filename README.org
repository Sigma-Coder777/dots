* About The Config
This is a Repository of my dotfiles for the softwares I use and configured till now.
There is a repo which contains some neat little scripts which help me to install any operating system (like Arch and Void) including Partitioning, Creating users, Grub etc which makes it super handy to reinstall and create virtual machines with exact same configurations.
